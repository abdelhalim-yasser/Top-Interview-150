## ðŸ§  Approach: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

This elegant algorithm lets us find the majority element using **O(1) space** and **O(n) time**.

We treat the majority element like a president candidate:
- If a number supports the candidate â†’ we increase his votes.
- If not â†’ we decrease the votes.
- If the votes drop to 0 â†’ we choose a new candidate.

Since the majority element appears more than n/2 times, it cannot be fully canceled out.

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Steps:

1. Initialize `count = 0` and `candidate = 0`.
2. For every number in the array:
   - If `count == 0`, assign the current number as the candidate.
   - If current number equals candidate â†’ `count++`.
   - Else â†’ `count--`.
3. Return the final candidate.
